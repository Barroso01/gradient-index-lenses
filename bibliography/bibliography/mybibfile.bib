abstract = {We present the microoptical adaption of the natural superposition compound eye, which is termed ``Gabor superlens''. Enabled by state-of-the-art microoptics technology, this well known principle has been adapted for ultra-compact imaging systems for the first time. By numerical ray tracing optimization, and by adding diaphragm layers and a field lens array, the optical performance of the Gabor superlens is potentially comparable to miniaturized conventional lens modules, such as currently integrated in mobile phones. However, in contrast to those, the Gabor superlens is fabricated using a standard microlens array technology with low sag heights and small diameter microlenses. Hence, there is no need for complex diamond turning for the generation of the master structures. This results in a simple and well controllable lens manufacturing process with the potential to high yield.},

abstract = {Ray tracing in gradient-index (GRIN) media has been traditionally performed either by using the analytical or numerical solutions to the Eikonal equation or by creating a layered medium where Snell\&\#x2019;s law is calculated in each layer. In this paper, an exact general method to perform ray tracing in GRIN media is presented based on the invariants of the system as stated by Fermat\&\#x2019;s principle when the media presents symmetries. Its advantage, compared with other methods reported in the literature, relies on its easy implementation. Besides the GRIN distribution and the initial conditions of the incident ray, once the invariants of the system are stated the resulting math is simple to solve and interpret. To benchmark the algorithm, ray tracing in typical cases of GRIN media is calculated, finding minimal discrepancies between the analytical solutions and our simulations. The used media are axial refractive index and parabolic index fiber and lenses with spherical gradient-index symmetry, such as: Luneburg\&\#x2019;s, Gutman\&\#x2019;s, generalized Maxwell\&\#x2019;s Fish-eye, Eaton\&\#x2019;s, and concentrator lenses. Our method can be further applied to distributions with symmetries associated with other common curvilinear orthogonal coordinate systems, in particular to those associated to the separability of the Helmholtz equation that would allow us to investigate wave optics in these GRIN media with the associated geometries.},

abstract = {Typically, as a means to obtain a less complicated ray tracing method on a gradient-index (GRIN) medium, a normalization is done. This normalization is based upon the fact that the values of the refractive index on the surface of the GRIN medium and the value of the refractive index medium where it is immersed are the same. In this paper, a Fermat's-ray-invariants-based ray tracing method in a non-normalized GRIN medium is presented. This method is so simple that it is no longer necessary to perform normalization to reduce ray tracing complications in GRIN media. In order to observe its operation, the method is implemented in different GRIN media with rectangular, cylindrical, and spherical symmetry. Also, the method is implemented in two different axicon GRIN lenses. MATLAB codes for the implementations are provided as supplementary files. Finally, it is possible to observe that the Fermat's ray invariant is still preserved even outside the lens. This implies that it is not necessary to apply Snell's law when the ray leaves the GRIN medium, because the conservation of the Fermat's ray invariant performs the refraction as if Snell's law had been applied.},
