Plasmonic structures work very well when amplifying electromagnetic modes. Furthermore, the work shows that these structures can be present in many distinct optical structures that have different parameters. With the help of analytic modeling, it is possible to design a structure to amplify electromagnetic modes of interest. By evaluating the engineering problems that come with this phenomena, its a mere certainty that this technology is set to become a pinnacle in the current mainstream of quantum technologies.\\
